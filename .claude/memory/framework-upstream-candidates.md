# Framework sync ledger (upstream candidates + fork merge map)

Framework-generic changes built in a fork are flagged under **Pending**, recreated
here in manuSpine (never cherry-picked), and moved to **Landed**. Forks then run
`git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/master`. Three skills drive the cycle:

- `flag-upstream` — in a fork, right after building something generic: adds a Pending entry.
- `port-upstream` — here in manuSpine: lands Pending items, moves them to Landed.
- `pull-upstream` — in a fork: merges upstream and uses **Landed** below as its
  conflict map. Keep the per-item deviations and merge notes accurate — they are
  read by the next fork session before it merges.

## Fork status (as of 2026-08-26)

- **manuHunter** (`master`) — **merged everything through `161e57e` on
  2026-08-26** (merge commits `2e23707` then `f0f29f0`): the tier-generic nav/route
  work, the 2026-08-26 security batch, and the compute-service hardening above.
  Verified after: `tsc --noEmit` and a full `vite build` clean, all 24 backend
  files parse, no conflict markers, and the `pwa/src` verbatim surface
  ([[fork-verbatim-surface]]) reduced to its two legitimate `pages/cv` +
  `pages/jobs` folders — every other file byte-identical. In `nodejs/` only the
  four genuinely app-tuned files differ (`backend.js`, `permissions.js`,
  `schema/index.js`, `schema/types.js`); the one framework-file drift it carried
  (a specialised comment in `routes/framework/files.js`) was reverted.

  **Deviations now in force** — the fork's `user` rung is **empty by design**:
  jobs, CV *and surveys* all sit in `registered`, owner-scoped in the resolvers.
  So its `NAV_AREAS` entries read `tier: 'registered'` (SURVEYS included, where
  upstream uses `'user'`) and its survey route stays on `PrivateRoute`. The merge
  silently took upstream's `TierRoute minTier="user"` for that route and had to be
  reverted — **check this every time**: nav and route guards mirror the *fork's*
  `permissions.js`, never upstream's. Also still in force: no public tier (gate
  adapted, no `permissions.public` lookup); upstream's generic `form_user_profile`
  d050 block deleted in favour of its richer same-name form in `03-init-cv.sql`;
  CV template seeds set `options.language: "latex"`; Dockerfile keeps TeX Live,
  no `hdf5-tools`; role-inverting lines re-worded fork-side in exactly four shared
  files — `rules/backend-api.md`, `skills/new-api`, `skills/new-role`,
  `skills/predeploy-audit` (`rules/db-schema.md` was on this list and no longer
  diverges). Those four are the whole `.claude/` divergence; anything else
  differing there is drift.

  **Merge-artifact lesson:** `schema/types.js` came out with `UserProfileType` and
  `UserSecretType` exported twice — the fork's list plus upstream's appended. Grep
  merged export blocks for duplicate keys; `node --check` will not catch it.

- **manuBeat** (`master`) — has NOT merged; last merged upstream **pre-port**
  (at 67c3a10), so its next pull brings the entire batch at once — and the
  security-critical GraphQL gate fix: its `schema/index.js` carries the
  first-selection-only bypass until it merges. Heaviest follow-up is auth: the
  tier-based lockdown defaults every GraphQL op to admin-only and adds REST
  guards, so manuBeat's domain surface (bedside telemetry ingest, device-token
  routes, WebSocket monitor, medical content) must be explicitly placed in tiers
  during the merge or it breaks silently. Review device-token auth paths against
  the new REST guards; `SECRETS_MASTER_KEY` must be added to its env. The
  2026-07-04 survey reframe hits it hardest: its `bedside` domain models a
  patient as a survey answer on `f000` — see that item's merge note below. It
  additionally receives the whole 2026-08-26 security batch below, of which the
  **deactivation check** and **device-token routes** need real thought: the JWT
  middleware now requires a live `users.is_active` row, so any device or agent
  authenticating with something that is not a real user row will start getting
  `req.user = null`.

## Landed in manuSpine (all ported 2026-07-02) — merge notes per item

- ✅ **`.claude/` config layout (rules/, skills/, CLAUDE.md sections)**.
  On merge: take upstream for shared rules/skills; fork-specific rules and
  CLAUDE.md domain sections stay fork-side.
- ✅ **FormRenderer `lines` + `code` field types, CodeEditor** — **deviation**:
  upstream CodeEditor is generalised behind a `language` prop (tokenizer registry
  in `CodeEditor.tsx`; `latex` is the only built-in, unknown → plain text);
  FormRenderer passes `options.language`. manuHunter's copy is LaTeX-hardcoded.
  On merge: manuHunter takes upstream and sets `options.language: "latex"` at its
  CV-builder call sites/seeds; drop its hardcoded tokenizer.
- ✅ **PdfViewer shell component** — ported as-is; no conflict expected.
- ✅ **Small shell tweaks** — `TreeEditor` `rootEditable`, `ResourcePanel`
  sub-label skip + `getBadge: Badge | Badge[]` (stacked), AreaShell ICON_MAP
  additions (briefcase/download/people/key/person/settings). Take upstream.
- ✅ **DataTable column-aware filters (Tier 1)** — ported verbatim
  (`filterOptions`/`columnTypes` props, typed operators). Tier 2 (server-side
  structured filtering) remains a follow-up in **all** repos.
- ✅ **Collapsible layout columns (SplitPageLayout + AreaShell)** — as-is
  (rotated-title rail; icon-only rail variant still an open idea; mobile not
  addressed).
- ✅ **SinglePanelLayout + User area** — layout + `pages/user/` Profile / Account /
  Settings (dark-mode toggle lives in Settings now, not Menu/AppHeader),
  `AREA_NAV.USER`. **Deviation**: manuSpine seeds a minimal generic
  `form_user_profile` (name / contact email / website, d050–d053). On merge:
  forks keep the form **name** but may replace the fields (manuHunter already has
  a richer profile incl. picture — its seed fields win, form name stays).
- ✅ **User account: `user_profile` + `user_secrets` keychain + Users backoffice
  page** — DDL, d000/d010 seeds, `lib/secrets.js`, `secrets-registry.js`, users
  resolvers, `SECRETS_MASTER_KEY` env, Settings Integrations card,
  `backoffice/Users.tsx`. Content page's Anthropic key comes from the keychain
  (Content.tsx + `generateContent` signature). On merge: `secrets-registry.js` is
  app-tuned — fork keeps its own entries, takes upstream structure; every fork
  must have `SECRETS_MASTER_KEY` set in its env/compose.
- ✅ **`registered` role + self-registration** — `POST /api/register`,
  `AuthContext` `isUser`/`register`, `UserRoute`, SignIn register mode, role seeds.
- ✅ **Roles catalogue + tier-based enforcement + Roles backoffice page** — roles
  table d020–d022 + forms d030/d040, `roles.js` resolver, tier claim in JWT,
  legacy-token normalisation, `backoffice/Roles.tsx`, `ROLE_TIERS`.
- ✅ **Auth lockdown** — unified query/mutation rule, tier checks, REST guards in
  compute/content/files, owner-scoped files. **Deliberate deviation**: manuSpine
  keeps a minimal `public` permissions tier containing **only** `componentByName`
  (read-only) so seeded Landing/CMS content is visible anonymously; manuHunter
  removed the public tier entirely. Invariant upstream: never add another op to
  `public`. On merge: `permissions.js`/`schema/index.js` conflict is expected —
  both are app-tuned; the **fork's** public-tier stance wins (manuHunter keeps
  no-public), and each fork must place its domain ops into tiers explicitly
  (everything unlisted becomes admin-only).
- ✅ **BuildKit apt cache mount (python image)** — mechanism only (syntax line,
  cache mounts, docker-clean removal). Package list is app-tuned: manuSpine ships
  `hdf5-tools`; manuHunter keeps TeX Live. On merge: take upstream mechanism,
  keep the fork's package list.

## Landed post-port (upstream-native, same merge batch)

Not from manuHunter — added directly in manuSpine after the port; forks receive
these in the same `merge upstream/master`:

- ✅ **Surveys opened to the registered tier** (060bbfe) — `permissions.js`
  survey ops moved to the registered tier; survey routes behind `UserRoute` in
  `App.tsx`; `Menu.tsx`/`constants.ts` adjusted. All four files are app-tuned →
  conflicts likely; take upstream's tier placement for survey ops, keep fork
  domain entries.
- ✅ **Upstream sync skills + diff-classifier agent** (b90b80d) —
  `flag-upstream`/`port-upstream`/`pull-upstream` skills, `diff-classifier`
  agent, one `.gitignore` line. Take upstream.
- ✅ **Five development-loop agents** (d37a8b5) — pattern-scout,
  convention-reviewer, slice-mapper, seed-author, ui-composer under
  `.claude/agents/`. Take upstream.
- ✅ **GraphQL gate hardening** (475730f, 2026-07-04) — the permission gate now
  resolves the executed operation (`getOperationAST`) and enforces **every**
  top-level field (fragment spreads expanded, fail closed); previously only
  `definitions[0].selections[0]` was checked, so batching a privileged field
  behind an allowed one — or leading with a fragment definition — bypassed
  enforcement entirely (resolvers never check auth themselves). Rule line added
  to `backend-api.md`. On merge: `schema/index.js` conflict is expected
  (app-tuned) — the fork **must take upstream's gate mechanism**
  (`topLevelFieldNames` + the per-field loop) and keep only its own tier-list
  stance (e.g. manuHunter's no-public tier). Do not keep the fork's old
  single-name gate.
- ✅ **Seeded dev-guide auth docs updated to tier model** (8fccead, 2026-07-04) —
  `seed-landing.sql`: permissions card rewritten (tier lists + every-top-level-
  field gate), role→tier checks fixed in the JWT-middleware, writing-routes,
  file-upload, pages-routing, and auth-architecture cards. On merge: take
  upstream where the fork kept the framework dev-guide seeds; applies only
  after `./run reset`.
- ✅ **Login rate limiting** (2de9b96, 2026-07-04) — `express-rate-limit` on
  `POST /login` (10 failed attempts per IP per 15 min; successful logins don't
  count) in `routes/framework/auth.js`, plus `trust proxy: 1` in `backend.js`
  for the single Caddy hop. On merge: take upstream (`auth.js`, `backend.js`,
  `package.json`/lockfile); rebuild the node image for the new dependency.
- ✅ **Survey reframe: owner-scoped answers + User Feedback demo + stats/compute
  removal** (c0c68f0 / 1af9aaf / 9a4bfc3 / aae96c5 / 2ee6d3b, 2026-07-04) —
  fixes the two owner-scoping majors from the exposure audit. Four parts:
  (1) `survey_answers.owner_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id)` + owner-scoped
  resolvers (`surveyAnswers`/`updateAnswer` filter non-admins; `submitAnswer`
  stamps `ctx.user.id`; `deleteAnswer` admin-only; `SurveyAnswerType` gains
  `owner_id`/`owner_email`; Answers tab: admin-only By column + Delete). The
  Survey System region moved **after** Users & Auth in `01-init-db.sql` (the FK
  needs `users`). (2) Seeded `f000` survey reframed Patient Registration → User
  Feedback (`surv_fb_*`, e000–e00d); `seed-sample-surveys.sql` deleted.
  (3) Stats layer removed: `surveyStats` resolver, `routes/framework/compute.js`,
  the Stats tab, `getSurveyStats`, `ENDPOINT.SURVEY_EXPORT`,
  `python/api/domains/compute/` + pandas — the Python service is an empty
  `/health` scaffold (framework ships no domains). (4) Survey/stats screenshots
  deleted; App Guide survey cards + Dev Guide rewritten; docs/rules/skills point
  at manuHunter's `cv/compile.js` + `latex/routes.py` as the compute exemplars.
  On merge: **schema is reset-only, so `owner_id NOT NULL` lands via
  `./run reset`** — any fork with domain code writing/reading `survey_answers`
  must adapt to the owner column and scoped resolvers. **manuBeat's `bedside`
  domain is a head-on collision** (a patient IS a survey answer on `f000`):
  keep its own Patient Registration seed content if it wants it (app-tuned
  seed wins), but it must take upstream's `survey_answers` DDL + resolver
  scoping and decide who owns bedside-created answers. Forks keep their own
  `python/api/domains/<domain>/` and Node compute callers (only the framework
  `compute` domain and its `compute.js` route were deleted); regenerate
  `requirements.lock` if the fork inherits the pandas removal.

## Landed 2026-08-26 — the manuHunter audit batch (upstream-native)

Not ported from a fork: manuHunter's pre-deployment audit swept **shared
framework code**, so its findings were manuSpine bugs. Fixed here; both forks
receive them on their next `merge upstream/master`. Details and open follow-ups:
[[pre-deployment-todo]].

- ✅ **Owner-scoping primitives** (`schema/helpers/ownership.js`) — `userId`,
  `isAdmin`, `assertOwner`, `assertReadable`, `ownerScope`, extracted from
  manuHunter's `resolvers/cv/documents.js`. `users.js` and `survey.js`
  refactored onto them. On merge: **take upstream and delete the fork's local
  copies** — manuHunter's `assertWritable`/`assertReadable`/`readScope` in
  `cv/documents.js` and `assertApplicationOwner` in `jobs/applications.js` are
  the same functions; keep its `applications` table's `user_id` column name by
  passing `{ column: 'user_id' }`. **manuBeat: `survey.js` changed** — its
  `bedside` domain leans on survey answers, so re-check its resolvers.
- ✅ **`downloadBlob`** (`pwa/src/utils/download.ts`, new dir) — fixes a leaked
  object URL in `DataTable`'s CSV export. On merge: manuHunter should collapse
  its three hand-rolled copies (GeneratedCvs, Applications, Artifacts) onto it.
- ✅ **Navigation single-sourced** — `NAV_AREAS` (constants.ts) now drives the
  drawer, the top-bar sections (`NAV_SECTIONS`, derived) and the in-page rail;
  `ICON_MAP` lifted to `components/shell/icons.ts`; `Menu.tsx` no longer
  hardcodes areas. **`AREA_NAV`'s shape is unchanged**, so pages keep working.
  On merge: conflict in `constants.ts` and `Menu.tsx` is expected — take
  upstream's mechanism, then re-add fork areas as `NAV_AREAS` entries
  (manuHunter: APPLICATIONS and CV_BUILDER) instead of Menu JSX blocks.
- ✅ **`UserRoute` / `isUser` / `userOnly` deleted** — dead in all three repos.
  On merge: drop any remaining import.
- ✅ **File download lockdown** — `files.is_public` + owner-or-admin on both
  routes, `download-by-key` resolved through the `files` table, inline mime
  allowlist, `nosniff`, single not-found-or-not-authorised error.
  **Reset-only**: a fork picks the column up on its own `./run reset`, and until
  then its content images 403. **manuHunter especially**: its generated CV PDFs
  and application artifacts are served through these routes — they are private
  uploads and stay private, which is the intended fix for its own
  download-scoping blocker, but re-check every `data.src` it seeds.
- ✅ **`/register` throttled + password floor** — separate `registerLimiter`;
  `MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH` on register, change-password and admin user create.
- ✅ **Deactivation revokes** — JWT middleware re-checks `users.is_active`,
  fails closed. See the manuBeat device-token warning in Fork status above.
- ✅ **CORS removed, body cap set** (`express.json({ limit: '2mb' })`), `cors`
  dependency dropped. On merge: a fork serving its frontend from a different
  host must re-add CORS scoped to an explicit origin list — never bare `cors()`.
- ✅ **Deploy hardening** — Caddy `header` block (HSTS/nosniff/frame-ancestors),
  dev compose ports on `127.0.0.1`, `ship-app.sh` secret-length preflight,
  `provision.sh` ufw default-deny. The Caddy block does **not** reach an
  already-provisioned box; hand-copy it.
- ✅ **Rules updated** — `backend-api.md` (ownership primitives, no existence
  oracle, both-ends link auth, deactivation), `db-schema.md` (shared NULL-owned
  rows), `files-storage.md` (`is_public`), `python-compute.md` (subprocess
  sandboxing), `code-reuse.md` (adding an area). Take upstream.
- ✅ **Lockfile regenerated** (60f12b9) — `nodejs/package-lock.json` now matches
  `multer ^2.0.2` with `cors` dropped. Take upstream; rebuild the node image.
- ✅ **`python/requirements.lock` orphans dropped** — `pandas`, `numpy` and their
  transitives `python-dateutil`, `six` removed; the lock now matches
  `requirements.txt` (fastapi, uvicorn[standard], psycopg2-binary, requests,
  minio) at 30 pins. Done by the **hand-delete route** in
  `.claude/rules/python-compute.md`, not a container freeze — deliberate, because
  it isolates the change to the four orphans instead of churning every other pin
  to today's versions. (The old Pending entry said "never hand-edit"; the rule it
  deferred to sanctions hand-deletion when the dependency tree is obvious, and it
  is. The rule wins — that parenthetical is gone with the entry.) On merge: take
  upstream, then `./run rebuild python`.

## Landed 2026-08-26 (second batch) — compute-service hardening

Found by the post-merge `exposure-auditor` gate run during manuHunter's
pull-upstream. All three are **framework** bugs, so both forks inherit the fix.

- ✅ **Dev compose no longer hands the python service `.env`** (`docker-compose.yml`)
  — the compute service reads **zero** environment variables and is
  credential-free by rule, which `docker-compose.prod.yml` already stated in a
  comment while the dev file contradicted it. With a subprocess endpoint that can
  be made to read files (see below), `env_file: .env` put `JWT_SECRET`,
  `SECRETS_MASTER_KEY`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and the DB/MinIO passwords one request
  away from any signed-in account. On merge: take upstream.
- ✅ **`is_public` is admin-only** (`routes/framework/files.js`) — the PATCH owner
  scope decides *which* row a caller may touch, not *what* they may set, so any
  authenticated user could publish their own upload and expose it through the two
  tokenless download streams. Those are tokenless for content assets only. Guard
  added at the only place `is_public` is writable. On merge: take upstream; no
  fork behaviour changes (ImagePicker publishes from the admin-only Content page).
- ✅ **`python-compute.md` shelling-out rule gained two mandatory items** —
  restrict what the binary may READ (`openin_any`/`openout_any` for TeX; shell
  escape stops `\write18`, never `\input`), and never hand a subprocess's raw
  output to a non-admin (compiler logs exfiltrate whatever was read). The old
  three-item list is what let manuHunter's LaTeX endpoint ship with a file-read
  primitive. On merge: take upstream, then audit any fork subprocess endpoint
  against the new items — manuHunter's `latex/routes.py` needed both.

- ✅ **Stale symbol references purged from shared agents/skills** — found by the
  post-merge `dead-code-auditor` run. `convention-reviewer.md` and
  `slice-mapper.md` still offered `UserRoute` in their route-guard menus (deleted
  2026-08-26), `new-role/SKILL.md` still pointed at `isUser` (replaced by
  `hasTier`), and `new-page/SKILL.md` told sessions to add nav to
  `pwa/src/Menu.tsx` — a path that never existed and a step the nav
  single-sourcing removed. All four now name `TierRoute`/`hasTier`/`NAV_AREAS`.
  Historical mentions in this ledger's own Landed entries are records, not
  instructions, and stay. On merge: take upstream.
- ✅ **`lib/filestream.js` extracted** (`mayRead`, `INLINE_MIMES`, `streamFile`)
  — these were module-private inside `routes/framework/files.js`, so a domain
  route streaming its own `files` row had no way to reuse them and hand-rolled a
  bare MinIO pipe instead. That is exactly what manuHunter's
  `GET /api/cv/artifacts/:id/download` did: when the 2026-08-26 batch hardened the
  framework path (`nosniff`, the inline-mime allowlist, attachment fallback), the
  fork copy silently kept none of it. Behaviour of the two framework routes is
  unchanged. On merge: take upstream, then point any domain file-streaming route
  at `streamFile` and delete its hand-rolled headers — manuHunter's artifact
  download needed this.

## Pending

- **Retire `ComponentForm.tsx` and `ListModal.tsx` (2026-07-07)** —
  Where: `pwa/src/components/forms/ComponentForm.tsx` (+ its `ShowComponentModal` export and the `ComponentModal` interface in `pwa/src/interfaces/types.ts`), `pwa/src/components/forms/ListModal.tsx`.
  What: unimported in manuSpine, manuHunter, and manuBeat (only comment references). Configuration.tsx carries its own live copy of the editor-ID map ComponentForm duplicated. Delete both files and the orphaned interface.
  Strip: none.
  Decisions: none.
  Depends: none.

- **(Maybe) LaTeX compile service** — the `python/api/domains/latex/` compile
  endpoint (pdflatex, shell-escape disabled, temp dir, timeout) + the Node bridge
  pattern is largely generic ("compile a .tex string to PDF"). Borderline: it
  exists to serve the CV builder, but the compile primitive could live in
  manuSpine if another app needs LaTeX→PDF. Stays in manuHunter; revisit if a
  second consumer appears.

**Why:** manuSpine is the shared framework; generic improvements made in a derived
app must flow back so every app benefits and forks don't drift — and forks need an
accurate map of what a merge will bring and where it will conflict.

**How to apply:** in manuSpine, run `port-upstream` on Pending items (recreate from
the fork source, commit, move to Landed with deviations recorded). In a fork, run
`pull-upstream`: read the Landed merge notes above first, then
`git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/master` — never cherry-pick. On conflict,
fork keeps app-tuned content (permission tiers, seeds, package lists, registry
entries), takes upstream mechanism/framework files. Update the **Fork status**
section here (in manuSpine) once a fork has merged.
